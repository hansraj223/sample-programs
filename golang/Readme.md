### Golang difference with C language
- Golang only has one looping construct `for` which serves all purpose
- Golang switch case doesn't need break in each case, it executes only matching case. In C all cases after matching case gets executed if we don't break
- Golang doesn't support pointer arithematic as supported in C
- Using struct pointers, golang permits accessing members using dot `p.x` or `(*p).x` and in C arrow notation is used access members `p->x`
